Simple Trakt.tv Backup Scripts
==============================

This is a collection of simplistic shell scripts that allows to create
backups of personal data from the trakt.tv service. The personal data
is downloaded in JSON format and stored in an archive. The scripts use
version 2 of the trakt.tv API, which requires OAuth authentication.

The following are brief instructions of how to get started with these
scripts. The aim is to have a running setup with scheduled jobs that
perform regular backups at the end.

Create a new API app
--------------------

The trakt.tv API requires each app to be registered. The registration
process provides two keys, the "Client ID" and the "Client Secret", to
uniquely identify an app. Head over to the following page to register
your own app.

  https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications

Once the app is registered, the {setup.sh} script can be used to store
the two aforementioned keys in the {api-client} file. This will allow
subsequent communication with the trakt.tv API to succeed.

  $ ./setup.sh

Note that the scripts do not provide any OAuth endpoint of their own,
hence "PIN Authentication" has to be selected for the app.

Authenticate with PIN code
--------------------------

To associate the scripts with a specific trakt.tv user account, we now
perform a manual OAuth handshake using a PIN code. The PIN code can be
obtained by heading over to the following page.

  https://trakt.tv/pin/<your-app-id>

This will allow you to grant your newly created API app access to your
(or any other) trakt.tv account. Take note of the PIN code and use it
with the {trakt-auth.sh} script to finish authentication as follows.

  $ ./trakt-auth.sh -u <your-username> -c <the-pin-code>

Authentication information will be stored locally for each account that
has been authorized. The file {auth-<your-username>} holds a log of all
authentication handshakes.

Note that each grant is valid for 3 months and needs to be refreshed
periodically. The {trakt-auth.sh} script can perform the refresh on its
own within that period, no new PIN code is required. It is recommended
to configure a cron job to do the refresh as described below.

Perform manual backup run
-------------------------

Now that authentication is done, the {trakt-backup.sh} script is ready
to download personal data for authenticated accounts. Manually invoking
the script as follows will trigger a download.

  $ ./trakt-backup.sh -u <your-username>

This will create a {backup-<your-username>-<timestamp>.tar.gz} archive
containing your personal data in JSON format. Again it is recommended
to configure a cron job to perform backups as described below.

Configure cron jobs
-------------------

Setting up the scripts to run periodically is the best way to make sure
that regular backups are performed and that authentication information
is refreshed. The following are two exemplary entries in the cron table
that achieve this.

  44 4 * * 6 cd $HOME/trakt; ./trakt-backup.sh -u <your-username>
  55 4 4 * * cd $HOME/trakt; ./trakt-auth.sh -u <your-username>

This will run the backup job once a week and the authentication refresh
once a month. You now have a setup performing periodic backups of your
personal trakt.tv data. Have fun!
